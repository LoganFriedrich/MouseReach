GROUP L (CONTUSION 50kD) DEEP DIVE SUMMARY - KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Based on analysis run on 2025-02-11

MAJOR ISSUES DETECTED:

1. MASSIVE MANUAL-VIDEO DISCREPANCIES IN GROUP L (52.4% overall difference)
   - This is 2.5x worse than Group K (70kD): 20.5%
   - This is 1.8x worse than Group M (60kD): 29.1%
   - Group L has the WORST manual-video agreement of all contusion groups

2. SPECIFIC ANIMALS WITH SEVERE SCORING PROBLEMS:

   L13: +259.1% discrepancy (Video counts 3.6x MORE retrieved than manual!)
      - Affected across ALL test days
      - Manual: 56 total retrieved
      - Video: 201 total retrieved (145 more!)

   L10: +144.0% discrepancy (Video counts 2.4x MORE retrieved than manual!)
      - Manual: 77 total retrieved
      - Video: 188 total retrieved (111 more!)
      - WEIRD: This animal shows HIGHER post-injury than pre-injury for both manual AND video
      - Post-injury manual: 11.7, Pre-injury manual: 10.3
      - Post-injury video: 28.0, Pre-injury video: 17.3
      - This animal may have actually IMPROVED after injury (not expected for contusion)

   L02: +85.9% discrepancy (Video counts 1.9x MORE retrieved than manual!)
      - Manual: 81 total retrieved
      - Video: 151 total retrieved (70 more!)

   L12: +26.2% discrepancy
      - Also shows video HIGHER post-injury than pre-injury
      - Post-injury video: 15.7, Pre-injury video: 7.7

3. PATTERN: Video OVER-COUNTING "Retrieved" vs Manual
   - In problematic animals, Video consistently counts MORE retrieved pellets
   - But Video counts FEWER displaced pellets
   - This suggests DLC may be misclassifying "displaced" as "retrieved"
   - The sum should be constant (every contacted should be either retrieved or displaced)
   - But in these animals the pattern is: Video Retrieved goes UP, Video Displaced goes DOWN

4. GROUP L SHOWS UNUSUAL "RECOVERY" PATTERN:
   - Pre-injury Manual Retrieved: 70.33
   - Post-injury Manual Retrieved: 32.67
   - Recovery ratio: 46.4% (much HIGHER than expected!)

   Compare to:
   - Group K (70kD): 1.1% recovery (expected severe deficit)
   - Group M (60kD): 18.4% recovery

   This suggests:
   a) Group L may have had a MUCH MILDER injury than expected for 50kD, OR
   b) The pre-injury baseline is artificially LOW (training issues?), OR
   c) Scoring errors are inflating post-injury scores

5. GROUP L HAS LOWER PRE-INJURY BASELINE:
   - Group K (70kD): 109.67 manual retrieved
   - Group L (50kD): 70.33 manual retrieved
   - Group M (60kD): 129.33 manual retrieved

   Group L animals never learned the task as well as other groups.
   This could explain the "better recovery" - they had less to lose.

6. ANIMALS SHOWING ZERO PERFORMANCE POST-INJURY:
   - L01: 0 retrieved all post-injury days (complete deficit as expected)
   - L02: 0 retrieved post-injury (but video shows 1-2?)
   - L11: 1 retrieved at 1wk, then 0 (severe deficit)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION: WHAT'S WEIRD ABOUT GROUP L?
================================================================================

1. WORST MANUAL-VIDEO AGREEMENT OF ALL GROUPS (52.4% difference)
   - Suggests scoring quality issues specific to this group
   - May be scorer-dependent or video quality issue

2. FOUR ANIMALS (L02, L10, L12, L13) SHOW EXTREME VIDEO OVER-COUNTING
   - These 4 animals account for most of the discrepancy
   - Pattern is systematic: Video retrieves UP, Video displaced DOWN
   - Suggests DLC is misclassifying displaced as retrieved in these animals

3. GROUP L SHOWS "TOO GOOD" RECOVERY (46.4% vs expected ~0-20%)
   - This could be real (milder injury) or artifact (scoring errors)
   - Need to investigate: Was the injury actually delivered at 50kD?
   - Or is DLC inflating post-injury scores?

4. GROUP L HAD LOWER PRE-INJURY BASELINE (70 vs 109-129 in other groups)
   - May reflect poor training, lower motivation, or different cohort
   - Makes recovery calculations less meaningful

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. REVIEW VIDEOS for L02, L10, L12, L13
   - Focus on "Retrieved" vs "Displaced" calls
   - Check if DLC is systematically misclassifying these animals
   - May need to retrain DLC model or adjust thresholds

2. VERIFY INJURY for Group L
   - Check injury device calibration logs
   - Confirm 50kD was actually delivered
   - Group L recovery pattern suggests injury may have been milder than intended

3. RE-SCORE manually (blind) for flagged animals
   - Have second scorer review L02, L10, L12, L13
   - Use as validation set for DLC corrections

4. INVESTIGATE why Group L pre-injury baseline was low
   - Were these animals less motivated?
   - Training protocol differences?
   - Cohort effect?

5. CONSIDER EXCLUDING L02, L10, L12, L13 from final analysis
   - Until scoring discrepancies are resolved
   - Current data quality is too poor for reliable conclusions
